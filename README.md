# 17987-data-collection-api-sample
In this sample, you will learn how to send information to the Data Collector so that you can get analytics data for videos that are not viewed in a Brightcove web or SDK player. Note that this technique should not be used if you are using the Brightcove web or SDK players, as it will result in duplicated analytics data.

This repository contains all the code for your convenience:

<table>
	<thead>
		<th>File</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</thead>
	<tr>
		<td>index.html</td>
		<td>The sample as working HTML page</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>css/styles.css</td>
		<td>CSS used in the sample</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>js/index.js</td>
		<td>JavaScript used in the sample</td>
	</tr>
</table>
